# ðŸ“‘ Intern Backend Developer Assignment

- Copyright (c) River Flow Solutions, Jsc. 2025. All rights reserved.
- We only use the submissions for candidates evaluation.

## **A. Instructions**
- Candidate must fork this repository to a public repo under their name for submission. Notify email `hr@riverflow.solutions` when done.
- Build a **multi-organization Task Management backend** (organizations â†’ projects â†’ tasks) with basic collaboration and notifications.  
- **Stack**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx.
- Use Justfile for all run and development commands.
- Use Docker for deployment.
- Deliverables: GitHub repo, ER + System design diagrams, Dockerized deployment, README.

## **B. Task Management Requirements & Use Cases**

### **B1. Functional Scope**
- **Organizations & Users**
  - Each user belongs to an organization.  
  - Roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, **Member**.  

- **Projects**
  - Belong to one organization.  
  - Can add/remove members.  
  - Admin/Manager can create projects, Members can only participate.  

- **Tasks**
  - CRUD operations.  
  - Belong to a project.  
  - Fields: title, description, status (`todo/in-progress/done`), priority (`low/medium/high`), due_date, assignee.  
  - Status workflow: `todo â†’ in-progress â†’ done` (no complex review step).  

- **Collaboration**
  - Users can comment on tasks.  
  - Users can upload simple file attachments (local storage).  

- **Notifications**
  - Users receive a notification when:  
    - They are assigned a task.  
    - Task status changes.  
    - A comment is added to their task.  

- **Reports (Basic)**
  - Count of tasks by status in a project.  
  - List of overdue tasks.

### **B2. Use Cases**
1. **User Management**
   - Register/login with JWT.  
   - Admin adds users to the organization.  

2. **Project Management**
   - Create/list projects.  
   - Add/remove project members.  

3. **Task Management**
   - Create tasks with title, description, assignee, priority, due date.  
   - Update task status (`todo â†’ in-progress â†’ done`).  
   - List tasks in a project (filter by status, assignee, priority).  

4. **Collaboration**
   - Add comments to tasks.  
   - Upload attachment to a task.  

5. **Notifications**
   - Retrieve unread notifications.  
   - Mark notifications as read.  

6. **Reporting**
   - Get per-project task count by status.  
   - Get overdue tasks in a project.  

---

### **B3. Business Rules**
- Only project members can create or update tasks in that project.  
- Only Admin/Manager can assign tasks to others. Members can assign only to themselves.  
- Due date must be today or in the future (not past).  
- Task status can only progress forward (`todo â†’ in-progress â†’ done`), but not backward.  
- Attachments limited to 5MB each, max 3 per task.  

---

## **C. Tech Requirements**
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic migrations.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with foreign keys + indexes.  
- **Cache/Notify**: Redis for caching task lists and storing notifications.  
- **Auth**: JWT (PyJWT) + role-based access (Admin/Manager/Member).  
- **Testing**: pytest with mock PostgreSQL & Redis.  
- **Deployment**: Docker + docker-compose (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Nginx).
